 		<h1>IOT vision </h1>
 		<p>
 			The IoT includes many objects (preferably smart
			objects) connected and communicating
			effectively with people on the Internet to help
			solve the problems of the world
		</p>
 		<p>
 			The end goal is to have plug-n-play smart objects that can be deployed in any environment with an interoperable interconnection backbone that allows them to blend with other smart objects around them. Standardization of frequency bands and protocols plays a pivotal role in accomplishing this goal.
