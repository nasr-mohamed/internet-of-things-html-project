 		<center><h1>IoT Applications</h1></center>
 		<h2>The extensive set of applications for IoT devices is often divided into : </h2>
 		<ol>
 			<li>Consumer applications
 				<ul>
 					<li>Smart home :
 						<p> IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, which can 				include lighting, heating and air conditioning, media and security systems. Long-term 	  benefits could include energy savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics 	 are turned off.
 						</p>
 					</li>
 					<li>Elder care :
 						 
 						<p>
 							Voice control can assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems can be connected directly to cochlear implants worn by hearing-impaired users.
 						</p>
 					</li>
 				</ul>
 			</li>
 			<li>Organisational applications
 				<ul>
 					<li>Medical and healthcare :
 						<p> 
 						IoT devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems. These health monitoring devices can range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to advanced devices capable of monitoring specialized implants, such as pacemakers, Fitbit electronic wristbands, or advanced hearing aids.
 						</p>
 					</li>
 					<li> Transportation :
 						
 						 <p>
 							 The IoT can assist in the integration of communications, control, and information processing across various transportation systems. Application of the IoT extends to all aspects of transportation systems (i.e. the vehicle,the infrastructure, and the driver or user). Dynamic interaction between these components of a transport system enables inter- and intra-vehicular communication,smart traffic control, smart parking, electronic toll collection systems, logistics and fleet management, vehicle control, safety, and road assistance.
 						</p>
 					</li>
 				</ul>

 			</li>
 			<li>Industrial applications
 				<ul>
 					<li>Manufacturing :
 						<p> 
 							The IoT can realize the seamless integration of various manufacturing devices equipped with sensing, identification, processing, communication, actuation, and networking capabilities. Based on such a highly integrated smart cyber-physical space, it opens the door to create whole new business and market opportunities for manufacturing. Network control and management of manufacturing equipment, asset and situation management, or manufacturing process control bring the IoT within the realm of industrial applications and smart manufacturing as well.The IoT intelligent systems enable rapid manufacturing of new products, dynamic response to product demands, and real-time optimization of manufacturing production and supply chain networks, by networking machinery, sensors and control systems together.
 						</p>
 					</li>

 					<li>Agriculture :
 						 <p>
 						 	There are numerous IoT applications in farming such as collecting data on temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, pest infestation, and soil content. This data can be used to automate farming techniques, take informed decisions to improve quality and quantity, minimize risk and waste, and reduce effort required to manage crops. For example, farmers can now monitor soil temperature and moisture from afar, and even apply IoT-acquired data to precision fertilization programs.
